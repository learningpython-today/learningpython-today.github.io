Section 4, September 28-30
==========================

Below are two dictionaries to use for your encryption problem.

We have also provided an additional code window for any extra work, but remember, the dictionaries do not exist in that window unless you copy them in.

See the handout for instructions.

.. activecode:: section_4_diction

	# A dictionary which holds info about which character corresponds to which number for our encryption
	char2num = {"a":0, "b":1, "c":2, "d":3, "e":4, "f":5, "g":6, "h":7, "i":8, "j":9, "k":10, "l":11, "m":12, "n":13, "o":14, "p":15, "q":16, "r":17, "s":18, "t":19, "u":20, "v":21, "w":22, "x":23, "y":24, "z":25, " ":26, ",":27, ".":28}
