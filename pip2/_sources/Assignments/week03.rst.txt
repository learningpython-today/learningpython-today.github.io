Activities: Week 3
==================

You have the following activities to complete:

* **Before class Tuesday:**

  * Read :ref:`Iteration<iteration_chap>`.
  * And try as many of the exercises as you can, thinking about them and noting what's confusing, what's hard

* **Before class Thursday:**

  * Read :ref:`Conditionals <conditionals_chap>`
  * Read :ref:`File Input/Output <files_chap>`
  * Additionally, here are some more introductory videos about concepts we are looking at this week. You may find them very useful; I recommend you watch/listen to them:

    * `Split and Join string methods <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GsNQkIskaY>`_
    * `Code blocks <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVoutOx3hMM>`_
    * `For loops and iteration <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIlOfoy4iZk>`_
    * `The accumulation pattern <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT7q2JTNHog>`_
    * `Booleans <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUAUWU9Pank>`_
    * `Conditionals <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3K44gSruoY>`_



* By **Sunday at 11:59PM**, save answers to the exercises in **Problem Set 2**:

  * Complete each of the problem set problems.
  * Submit your Demonstrate Your Understanding 3 assignment.
  * Resubmit your last DYU (DYU 2) if you did not get full credit on it.

   Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an
   original formulation of a computing problem to executable programs. It involves
   activities such as analysis, understanding, and generically solving such problems
   resulting in an algorithm, verification of requirements of the algorithm including its
   correctness and its resource consumption, implementation (or coding) of the algorithm in
   a target programming language, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code,
   implementation of the build system and management of derived artefacts such as machine
   code of computer programs. The algorithm is often only represented in human-parseable
   form and reasoned about using logic. Source code is written in one or more programming
   languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, Smalltalk, JavaScript, etc.). The purpose of
   programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a
   specific task or solve a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires
   expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
   specialized algorithms and formal logic.
   Within software engineering, programming (the implementation) is regarded as one phase in a software development process. There is an on-going debate on the extent to which
   the writing of programs is an art form, a craft, or an engineering discipline. In
   general, good programming is considered to be the measured application of all three,
   with the goal of producing an efficient and evolvable software solution (the criteria
   for "efficient" and "evolvable" vary considerably). The discipline differs from many
   other technical professions in that programmers, in general, do not need to be licensed
   or pass any standardized (or governmentally regulated) certification tests in order to
   call themselves "programmers" or even "software engineers." Because the discipline
   covers many areas, which may or may not include critical applications, it is debatable
   whether licensing is required for the profession as a whole. In most cases, the
   discipline is self-governed by the entities which require the programming, and sometimes
   very strict environments are defined (e.g. United States Air Force use of AdaCore and
   security clearance). However, representing oneself as a "professional software engineer"
   without a license from an accredited institution is illegal in many parts of the world.

    Write one for loop to print out each element of the list ``several_things``. Then, write *another* for loop to print out the TYPE of each element of the list called ``several_things``. To complete this problem you should have written two different for loops, each of which iterates over the list ``several_things``, but each of those 2 for loops should have a different result.
    ~~~~
    several_things = ["hello", 2, 4, 6.0, 7.5, 234352354, "the end", "", 99]

   The program below doesn't always work as intended. Try uncommenting different lines setting the initial value of x. Tests will run at the end of your code, and you will get diagnostic error messages.

   Fix the code so that it passes the test for each different value of x. So when the first line is uncommented, and when the second line, third line, and fourth line are each uncommented, you should always pass the test.

   (HINT: you don't have to make a big change!)

   How many characters are in each element of list ``lp``? Write code to print the length (number of characters) of each element of the list, on a separate line. (Do not write 8+ lines of code to do this. Use a for loop.)

   The output you get should be:

     5
     13
     11
     12
     3
     12
     11

   Use iteration (a for loop).
