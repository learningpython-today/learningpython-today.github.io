Activities: Week 13 (last week of class)
========================================

* **For class 12/5:**

    * TBD.

    
* **Section this week will be structured time to work on projects.** More info TBA.

.. note:: **Schedule Your Project Work Time**

    We also strongly suggest you spend time each day this week, even if it is just a few minutes, working on your project! Here's a suggested order of tasks:

        1.  Make sure you can grab data from both your sources and deal with it in Python, and cache the data, like in your project plan. 

        2. Write out English descriptions of everything you think you'll need to do for your project to get the clear output you plan on and fulfill all of the requirements. (You may change your English descriptions along the way, as you work, of course -- that's OK, it'll give you a good start.) Try writing some pieces of code, like your class definitions (Problem #1 in PS9 is a good model for how to plan a class definition). And talk to staff about anything that was brought up in the feedback on your project plan, on the Facebook Group or otherwise!

        3. Write some unit tests that test for things you know you'll need your project to do: should the ``twitter_data`` variable you plan to use contain something that is a Python dictionary type? Write that unit test. Etc. 

        4. Check through the English plan you've written for yourself. e.g. perhaps it begins like, *"Get the last 500 posts from the University of Michigan Facebook page, and save it in a variable ``fb_umich_data``. Cache the data in a file."* And then, *"Define a class FacebookPost which should have the following instance variables and methods..."*, and so on...

        5. Proceed through translating your English into code, one piece at a time, running your file every time you finish more code, to make sure it's working and checking whether you pass your unit tests.

    The Facebook problem set (PS 9) is a good structure to base your project on, and the Flickr problem set (PS 8) may also be especially useful to look back at!

* **Project Work Time TBA**
