  * When you come to a confusion OR a sudden realization, please post on Piazza! You do NOT need to get these correct -- this is just experience and practice, but you should share how you think about it on Piazza.

  * There are also some video resources for a bunch of these topics. If you find these helpful, I strongly suggest watching them. Each is a few minutes long. Especially,
