Problem Set
-----------

Note especially for this problem set, since you're getting real live data, we cannot test everything. You'll have to both look at our tests and instructions and examine your output to ensure that you have reasonable results. We will look at your results and output when we grade the problem set. **We do not grade problem sets that do not run.** Make sure you have no syntax errors!

----

The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) has put out a REST API for accessing current information about US airports. You'll be using it in problems 3-10 of your problem set this week!
