Activities: Week 8
==================

**This problem set is temporarily unavailable and will be updated soon.**

* **Before class Tuesday:**

  * Read :ref:`Nested Data and Nested Iteration<nested_chap>` and try exercises in the section. Trying out and playing around with this code prior to lecture is especially important!
  * Read :ref:`Exceptions, Try/Except <exceptions_chap>`

* **Before class Thursday:**

  * Read :ref:`String Formatting<formatting_chap>`
  * Read the :ref:`Requests for Internet Data<requests_chap>` chapter
  * You may find it helpful to read this `External Tutorial on Reading CSV Files <https://thenewcircle.com/s/post/1572/python_for_beginners_reading_and_manipulating_csv_files>`_ and  :ref:`Writing files<write_text_file_chap>` (also note :ref:`Writing CSV files<csv_chap>`)
  * Read the short section on :ref:`Python modules <modules_chap>`
  * Make sure to read :ref:`pip module installer <pip_chap>` (and install the ``pip`` module by downloading the `get-pip.py` program and running it with admin permissions -- see Piazza for help with this if you have any problems!)


* **Before Sunday at 11:59 PM:**

  * Complete the Demonstrate Understanding for this week. Your Problem Set has been extended.
